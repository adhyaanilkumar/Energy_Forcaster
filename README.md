# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting
Predicting the energy consumptions of various countries using R programming
Forecasting Goals

Goal: Build a robust forecasting model to predict energy consumption for selected countries up to one year into the future.

Time Range: Forecast energy consumption for the next 12 months (e.g., April 2025 - March 2026).

Accuracy Goals:

-Achieve an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of less than 10% of the mean energy consumption values for each country.
-Keep the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) below 15% for all countries.

Granularity:

-Focus on monthly or daily predictions based on available data.
